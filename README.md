• Move tables-i.e., almost all columns/rows-from database system (DBMS) storage into programming language (PL) heap.
• Count on the PL heap to be able to hold all required row data (otherwise try to chunk or stream data).
• Map rows to PL data structures, then perform in-heap computation to obtain result.
